> "The idea behind infrastructure as code (IAC) is that you write and execute code to define, deploy, update, and destroy your infrastructure. This represents an important shift in mindset in whichyou treat all aspects of operations as softwareâ€”even those aspects that represent hardware (e.g., setting upphysical servers). In fact, a key insight of DevOps is that you canmanage almost everything in code, including servers, databases, networks, log files, application configuration,documentation, automated tests, deployment processes, and so on." (Terraform up running: 2ed)
