# Variables Terraform

To allow you to make your code more DRY and more configurable, Terraform allows you to define input variables. Hereâ€™s the syntax for declaring a variable:
```tf  
variable "NAME" {
  [CONFIG ...]
}
```

The body of the variable declaration can contain three parameters, all of them optional:  
- Description
- default
- type

```tf  
variable "number_example" {  
  description = "An example of a number variable in Terraform"  
  type        = number  
  default     = 42
}
```  
Go to work directory and create into the folder a file named variables.tf and add the variables that your consider for dont do DRY.

In addition to input variables, Terraform also allows you to define output variables by using the following syntax:
```
output "<NAME>" {  
value = <VALUE>  [CONFIG ...]
}
```

Go to work directory and create into the folder a file name outputs.tf
